# Summer Of Science-2023 - Fundamentals of Machince Learning

This repository contains Python code for implementing various deep learning algorithms as part of my report on the fundamentals of deep learning. The code covers topics such as linear regression, logistic regression, feed-forward neural networks, and convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The implementations include examples using the MNIST dataset for digit classification and a CNN for the Cats vs Dogs image classification problem.

## Contents

The repository includes the following files and directories:

- `linear_regression.ipynb`: Python notebook implementing linear regression.
- `logistic_regression.ipynb`: Python notebook implementing logistic regression.
- `feed_forward_neural_network.ipynb`: Python notebook implementing a feed-forward neural network for MNIST dataset.
- `cnn_mnist.ipynb`: Python notebook implementing a CNN for the MNIST dataset.
- `cnn_cats_vs_dogs.ipynb`: Python notebook implementing a CNN for Cats vs Dogs classification.
- `data/`: Directory containing sample datasets used in the code examples.

## Requirements

To run the code in this repository, you need the following dependencies:

- Python 3.x
